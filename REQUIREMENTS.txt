# Inventory Management System - Requirements

## System Requirements

### Software Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 14 or higher
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 14 or higher
- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux

### Hardware Requirements
- Minimum 512 MB RAM
- 50 MB available disk space
- Standard keyboard for input

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. Product Management
   - Add products with unique ID
   - Store product name, quantity, and price
   - Prevent duplicate product IDs
   - Display product details

2. Inventory Operations
   - View all products in inventory
   - Search products by ID
   - Calculate total inventory value
   - Display individual product worth (quantity × price)

3. Data Persistence
   - Save inventory to file (products.txt)
   - Load inventory from file on startup
   - Auto-save on application exit
   - CSV format for data storage

4. User Interface
   - Command-line menu interface
   - Input validation and error handling
   - Clear user prompts and feedback

## Technical Requirements

### Programming Language
- Java (using Java 14+ features like switch expressions)

### Dependencies
- Java Standard Library
  - java.io.* (File I/O operations)
  - java.util.* (Collections and Scanner)

### Data Structure
- ArrayList for in-memory inventory storage
- Product class with encapsulated fields

### File Format
- CSV format: id,name,quantity,price
- Text file: products.txt

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Instant response for menu operations
- Efficient file I/O operations
- Support for reasonable inventory sizes (1000+ products)

### Usability
- Intuitive menu-driven interface
- Clear error messages
- Simple numeric menu selection

### Reliability
- Input validation for all user entries
- Exception handling for file operations
- Data integrity checks (duplicate ID prevention)

### Maintainability
- Clean, readable code structure
- Modular design with separate Product class
- Consistent naming conventions

## Constraints

- Single-user application (no concurrent access)
- No database integration (file-based storage only)
- Command-line interface only (no GUI)
- No network connectivity required
